## Setup Instructions

- Clone the repository
  
- Run ```npm install``` to install packages and dependencies
  
- Use ```npm run start:dev``` from the root directory to run **both** the frontend and the backend server
  
- use ```npm run start:frontend``` and ```npm run start:backend``` respectively to run either the frontend **or** the backend


## Collaboration Best Practices

- Before making changes to the code, run ```git pull``` to ensure your local code is up-to-date.

- Create a new branch before editing the project. Use ```git checkout -b <name-of-branch>``` to create a branch and switch to the newly created branch.

- Stage and commit changes often, so that you can revert to a previous commit if need be. 

- When you are finished with your changes, push the code in your branch to the remote version of your branch in GitHub.

- Go to the ```Pull Requests``` tab in the repository, and create a new pull request for the branch you've created. Add any details about the changes you've made, and you can assign someone to review the pull request before it gets merged to main.
